# Three-Card-Monte
This is the original "ball and cups" game where you try to find out which cup has the ball under it. You may play with three cups and a ball, three cards (two jacks and an ace), or three doors and a car. Basically, randomly select a cup to hide the "ball". Let the player guess which cup hides the ball. The player wins if they guess correctly.
